CSSH-Range
==========

Introduction
------------

CSSH-range is an avahi-backed cluster-ssh connection tool.
It allows you to connect to a range of hosts with cssh using a short command.
This tool is Useful in applications where clusters of unix-based IoT devices 
have to be administered.


Usage instructions
------------------

Cssh-range takes a hostname_base as argument, which is translated to a range
of hostnames by appending "-x" where x is an increasing index number.

For example:
  cssh-range.py foo
This will find and connect to all devices that announce their hostname via
the AVAHI daemon in range:
  foo-1.local foo-2.local foo-3.local ...

This is a common practice with avahi hostnames, where avahi appends an index to 
keep hostnames unique.
To get started, configure your devices with a common base hostname (usually in
the file /etc/hostname), for example "foo-1". The "-1" will automatically be
replaced with an incremental index by avahi to identify each device with a 
unique hostname.
Note that if you were to store "foo" in the hostname file, instead of "foo-1", 
the first device would get the hostname "foo" assigned, the others would get 
"foo-1", "foo-2", ... This makes the first unit fall outside of the range.

To use this tool, you need to have cssh or Cluster ssh installed. On 
debian-based systems it can be installed using:
  apt-get install clusterssh
This software is written in python and relies exclusively on the standard 
libraries. A Python2 interpreter is required to run.

Usage:
cssh-range.py [-h] [<username@>]<hostname_base> [<begin>] [<end>]
  cssh-range takes a hostname_base as argument, which is translated to a range
  of hostnames by appending "-x" where x is an increasing index number.

  hostname_base   The base hostname to use in the range
  username        The username to login to SSH with
  begin           Integer number where the range should begin
  end             Integer number where the range should stop (inclusive)
                  When only one number is specified, it's the end index, begin
                  defaults to 1
                  Not specifying begin and/or end index will use avahi-browse
                  to discover the available range and include all

  -h, --help      Shows this help message
  -l, --list      List hostnames in range only, do not connect
